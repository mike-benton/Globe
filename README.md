# Globe - A Spherical RPG Skill Tree

The shape of Globe allows many classes with overlapping abilities and skills to be placed within the same skill tree.
12 core classes, 6 physical and 6 magical, are placed on the 12 pentagons of the truncated icosohedron.
These core classes mark the starting points, or where an adventurer begins their journey.
As their skills grow, they move through the Globe, picking up abilities they may need.
With enough skills, the adventurers may begin to pick up skills of the neighboring classes through their respective combination classes.

I am implementing the Globe system using the Unity Engine.
Currently, I am in the process of constructing the multilinked list that is the truncated icosohedron.
Once I finish the tessellation algorithm, I will add abilities of each class to the sphere.
